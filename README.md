# ParkPat PWA

## Overview
ParkPat is a Progressive Web App (PWA) developed for monitoring the parking situation at the Metropolia University of Applied Sciences' Karamalmi campus. It was designed to provide real-time information about available parking spots, leveraging the campus's parking lot camera.

## Features
- **Real-Time Parking Spot Monitoring:** Users could view the current parking situation in real-time.
- **PWA Technology:** Implemented as a PWA for seamless use on any device with a web browser.
- **Historical Data Display:** The app provides statistics and data from previous days, allowing users to view and analyze parking trends over time.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple and intuitive UI, making it easy for users to check parking availability at a glance.

## Technologies Used
- **React:** For building the user interface.
- **NodeJS:** For handling server-side operations.

## Challenges and Learning
- **Integration with Live Camera Feed:** One of the key challenges was integrating the live feed from the parking lot camera into the app.
- **PWA Implementation:** Learning and implementing PWA technology to ensure the app is accessible and performs well on various devices.

## Project Status
The application is currently not live due to the loss of access to the parking lot camera. It was previously hosted at www.karaparkki.fi.
